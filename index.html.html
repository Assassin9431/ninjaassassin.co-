 <p> <b> Neymar Jr </b> <p>

<p><b>is one of the best players in the game currently. His skills, agility and dribbling skills are a sight to behold. There is a reason why Paris Saint-Germain spilt cash to win the much-coveted signature of the forward. In the meanwhile, making him the world's most expensive player by quite some margin. There is probably no one of the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. They are in a league of their own. But it is Neymar who comes the closest to their ranks.</b> </P>
the top 3 player who are almost have the same capability as neymar are:
<ul>
<li>hazard</li>
<li> salah </li>
<li> messi </li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>It was during his stint with the Brazilian-club Santos that he gathered some limelight. The acrobatic forward was the hottest item in the market and Barcelona came calling. He represented the club from 2013 to 2017. This period is termed as the best years of his career until now. He was part of a deadly trio MSN (Messi, Suarez, Neymar). The trio terrorized the opponents game-in-game-out. Barcelona managed to claim a treble in the 2014-15 season thanks to this trio only. He later joined the French club PSG in the summers of 2017.</strong> </p>
